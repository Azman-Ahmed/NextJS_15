# Next.js Notes

## Why Learn Next.js

1. **File-Based Routing**: Simple routing mechanism based on file structure.
2. **API Routes**: Create backend endpoints directly in the project without additional setup.
3. **SSR and CSR Rendering**: Supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for flexible rendering strategies.
4. **Simplified Data Fetching**: Built-in support for fetching data at different levels (SSG, SSR).
5. **Styling Options**: Flexible styling with CSS and Tailwind CSS.
6. **Optimization**: Features like image optimization, lazy loading, and built-in performance optimizations.
7. **Dev and Prod Build System**: Efficient build processes for development and production environments.

## Prerequisites

1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Fundamentals**
2. **ES6 Features**: Understanding of modern JavaScript features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, etc.
3. **React Fundamentals**: Basic knowledge of React, including components, props, and state.

## Next.js Project Setup

1. **Download and Install Node.js**
2. **Create a New Next.js App**: Run `npx create-next-app@latest playground`
3. **Project Setup Options**: Select the required features during setup, such as TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.
4. **Run the Project**: Run `npm run dev`

## Project Control Flow After Running

1. **package.json** → `dev` command
2. **layout.tsx** → `rootLayout` (defines the main layout structure)
3. **app/page.tsx** → Main content rendering for the root route
